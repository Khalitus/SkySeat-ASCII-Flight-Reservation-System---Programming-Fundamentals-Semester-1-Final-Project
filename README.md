## Skyseat ASCII Flight Reservation System.

This is a console program written in the C++ language which was designed as a semester project of Programming Fundamentals. It simulates an actual airline reservation, with booking of a flight, booking a seat using an ASCII seat map, ticketing and long-term storage using file management.

Clean logic, modular design and strong fundamentals are dedicated to the given project, that is why it is one of the best examples of entry-level skills of C++ programming language.

## WHAT The current project demonstrates.

Formatted programming using structs.
The representations of the seat maps in two-dimensional arrays.
Modular design that is based on functions.
Continued tampering with data storage files.
Checking of inputs and error checking.
Processing of menu-driven console programs.

## KEY FEATURES

Flights which are pre-calculated and have particular ID, route, and a price depending on the class.
ASCII visualization in 4x6 seat map.
Seat classification:
  - Row A – First Class
  - Row B – Business Class
  - Rows C & D – Economy Class
Booking and ensuring that duly booking is not done.
Generation of ticket ID automatically.
Ticket persistence through a file of tickets.txt.
Formerly booked seats are loaded upon program start-up.
Reveal all the reserves in case of leaving the program.

## TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS USED

Language:  
C++

Concepts:  
Structures  
Arrays and 2D arrays  
Functions  
File I/O (ifstream, ofstream)  
Conditional logic and loops  
Input validation  

## FILE HANDLING

The ticket is all stored as a text file which is named tickets.txt. When the program is opened, old tickets are loaded, booked seats are reloaded and the next ticket ID is calculated automatically.

## SEAT MAP LEGEND

O – Available seat  
X – Booked seat  

Seat format examples:  
A1, B3, C4

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

Use of Module of Programming.
Program design: program-structured and program-modular.
File-based data persistence
Safe handling of user input
